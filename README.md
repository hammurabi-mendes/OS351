Educational operating system for Intel x64

This is an educational operating system targeting an undergraduate-level OS course.
Most algorithms used in this demo have been chosen due to their simplicity, not efficiency, and were meant to illustrate
the workflow on creating an operating system from scratch.
In class, we address efficient algorithms and techniques - the student is then enabled to change the current algorithms
into more sophisticated ones.
